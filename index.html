<p>Pactus Improvement Proposals (PIPs) describe standards for the Pactus platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards. Network upgrades are discussed separately in the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus">Pactus Project</a> repository.</p>

<h2>PIP status terms</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Idea</strong> - An idea that is pre-draft. This is not tracked within the PIP Repository.
  <li><strong>Draft</strong> - The first formally tracked stage of an PIP in development. An PIP is merged by an PIP Editor into the PIP repository when properly formatted.</li>
  <li><strong>Review</strong> - An PIP Author marks an PIP as ready for and requesting Peer Review.</li>
  <li><strong>Last Call</strong> - This is the final review window for an PIP before moving to FINAL. An PIP editor will assign Last Call status and set a review end date (`last-call-deadline`), typically 14 days later. If this period results in necessary normative changes it will revert the PIP to Review.</li>
  <li><strong>Final</strong> - This PIP represents the final standard. A Final PIP exists in a state of finality and should only be updated to correct errata and add non-normative clarifications.</li>
  <li><strong>Stagnant</strong> - Any PIP in Draft or Review if inactive for a period of 6 months or greater is moved to Stagnant. An PIP may be resurrected from this state by Authors or PIP Editors through moving it back to Draft.</li>
  <li><strong>Withdrawn</strong> - The PIP Author(s) have withdrawn the proposed PIP. This state has finality and can no longer be resurrected using this PIP number. If the idea is pursued at later date it is considered a new proposal.</li>
  <li><strong>Living</strong> - A special status for PIPs that are designed to be continually updated and not reach a state of finality. This includes most notably PIP-1.</li>
</ul>
